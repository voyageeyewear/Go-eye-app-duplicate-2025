# 🔧 **Mobile APK Sync Troubleshooting Guide**

## 📱 **New APK with Debug Features**

**APK Location**: `/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### 🆕 **What's New in This APK**:
- **🔍 Debug Sync Button**: Green sync icon in the header (next to shopping cart)
- **📝 Enhanced Logging**: Detailed sync logs in Flutter console
- **⚡ Force Sync**: Manual sync trigger for testing

## 🔍 **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**

### **Step 1: Install the New APK**
1. Download the new APK from the path above
2. Install it on your mobile device
3. Open the app

### **Step 2: Check the Debug Sync Button**
1. Look for a **green sync icon** in the header (next to the shopping cart)
2. Tap the green sync button to manually trigger a sync
3. Watch for console logs (if you have Flutter console open)

### **Step 3: Test Manual Sync**
1. **Tap the green sync button** in the header
2. **Check Flutter console** for these messages:
   ```
   🚀 Starting sync service...
   ✅ Sync service started with 5s interval
   ⏰ Sync timer triggered
   🔄 Attempting to sync from: http://192.168.0.104:8082/api/customizations
   📡 Response status: 200
   📊 Received 76 customization items
   ✅ Local storage updated with web backend data
   ✅ Customizations synced from web backend
   ```

### **Step 4: Check Server Status**
The server is confirmed working:
- ✅ **Server Running**: Port 8082
- ✅ **API Accessible**: http://192.168.0.104:8082/api/customizations
- ✅ **Data Available**: 76 customization items
- ✅ **Network Access**: Mobile can reach the server

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: No Sync Button Visible**
- **Solution**: Make sure you installed the new APK (not the old one)
- **Check**: Look for green sync icon in header

### **Issue 2: Sync Button Doesn't Work**
- **Solution**: Check if your mobile device is on the same WiFi network as your computer
- **Test**: Try accessing http://192.168.0.104:8082 in your mobile browser

### **Issue 3: No Console Logs**
- **Solution**: Open Flutter console/terminal to see the logs
- **Alternative**: Check Android Studio/VS Code console

### **Issue 4: Sync Works But UI Doesn't Update**
- **Solution**: The issue is in the provider not listening to sync callbacks
- **Test**: Try restarting the app after sync

## 🔧 **Advanced Debugging**

### **Check Network Connectivity**
```bash
# On your mobile device, try accessing:
http://192.168.0.104:8082/health
```

### **Check Server Logs**
The server should show:
```
🌐 API GET /api/customizations - [MOBILE_IP]
```

### **Force Provider Refresh**
If sync works but UI doesn't update, the issue is in the provider. Try:
1. Go to Customize tab
2. Make a small change
3. Go back to Home tab
4. Check if changes appear

## 📋 **Expected Behavior**

### **When Sync Works Correctly**:
1. **Tap green sync button** → Console shows sync logs
2. **Wait 5 seconds** → Automatic sync should trigger
3. **Make changes on web app** → Changes appear on mobile within 5 seconds
4. **Server logs** → Show mobile device IP making requests

### **When Sync Fails**:
1. **Console shows errors** → Network or server issues
2. **No console logs** → Sync service not starting
3. **UI doesn't update** → Provider not listening to sync

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Install the new APK**
2. **Test the green sync button**
3. **Check console logs**
4. **Report what you see** (success/errors)

The server is working perfectly, so the issue is definitely in the Flutter app. The debug features will help us identify exactly where the problem is! 🔍
