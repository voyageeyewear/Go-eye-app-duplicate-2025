# 🚀 Vercel to Mobile APK Sync Setup

## ✅ **What You Need to Do**

To sync changes from your Vercel app (`https://go-eye-app-duplicate-2025.vercel.app/`) to your mobile APK, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Add the Sync Script to Your Vercel App**

1. **Open your Vercel app** in your code editor
2. **Add the sync script** to your main HTML file (usually `index.html` or the main page)
3. **Add this line** in the `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="vercel-to-mobile-sync.js"></script>
```

### **Step 2: Upload the Sync Script**

1. **Copy the `vercel-to-mobile-sync.js` file** to your Vercel project
2. **Deploy to Vercel** (git push or Vercel dashboard)

### **Step 3: Test the Sync**

1. **Open your Vercel app**: `https://go-eye-app-duplicate-2025.vercel.app/`
2. **Make changes** in the customization panel
3. **Look for the sync button** (🔄 Sync to Mobile) in the bottom-right corner
4. **Click the sync button** or wait for automatic sync
5. **Open your mobile APK** and tap the green sync button
6. **Verify changes appear** on your mobile app

## 🔧 **How It Works**

```
Vercel App → Sync Script → Local Server → Mobile APK
```

1. **Vercel App**: You make changes in the customization panel
2. **Sync Script**: Automatically detects changes and sends them to your local server
3. **Local Server**: Receives the data and stores it
4. **Mobile APK**: Syncs with local server and updates the UI

## 🎯 **Features**

- **✅ Automatic Sync**: Changes sync every 5 seconds
- **✅ Manual Sync**: Click the "🔄 Sync to Mobile" button
- **✅ Visual Feedback**: Status messages show sync success/failure
- **✅ Real-time Updates**: Changes appear on mobile immediately

## 🚨 **Requirements**

- **Local Server**: Must be running (`python3 web_server.py`)
- **Same Network**: Mobile device must be on same WiFi as your computer
- **Correct IP**: Server must be accessible at `192.168.0.121:8082`

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If sync doesn't work:**

1. **Check Local Server**: Ensure `python3 web_server.py` is running
2. **Check IP Address**: Verify your computer's IP is `192.168.0.121`
3. **Check Network**: Ensure mobile and computer are on same WiFi
4. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools to see sync logs
5. **Manual Sync**: Click the "🔄 Sync to Mobile" button

### **Expected Console Logs:**
```
🚀 Initializing Vercel to Mobile sync...
✅ Customization listeners setup complete
📡 Syncing to local server...
✅ Successfully synced to local server
```

## 🎉 **Result**

Once set up, any changes you make in your Vercel app will automatically sync to your mobile APK within 5 seconds!
