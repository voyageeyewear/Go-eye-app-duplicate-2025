# ✅ **SYNC ISSUE COMPLETELY FIXED!**

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified & Resolved**

### **Problem**: 
The mobile APK was showing placeholder content instead of customized data because:

1. **Storage Key Mismatch**: Sync service was saving to wrong key
2. **Missing Local Assets**: App was trying to load non-existent local images
3. **No Data Reload**: Provider wasn't reloading after sync
4. **404 Image Errors**: 20+ missing image files causing console errors

### **Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ **Fixed Storage Key**: Sync service now saves to correct key (`header_customization_data`)
2. ✅ **Replaced Local Assets**: All hardcoded local image paths replaced with working URLs
3. ✅ **Added Auto-Reload**: Provider automatically reloads data after sync
4. ✅ **Added Debug Features**: Manual sync button and detailed logging
